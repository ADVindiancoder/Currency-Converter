## Currency Converter
This is a simple currency converter web application that allows you to convert between different currencies. You can select two currencies, enter an amount in the first currency, and the equivalent amount will be displayed in the second currency based on the current exchange rate.

## Usage
To use the currency converter, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
## Features
Currency Selection: You can choose the currencies you want to convert between using two dropdown menus. The first dropdown represents the currency you have, and the second dropdown represents the currency you want to convert to.

## Amount Entry: Enter the amount of the first currency you want to convert in the input field next to the first dropdown.

## Conversion: Once you have selected the currencies and entered the amount, the equivalent amount in the second currency will be automatically calculated and displayed.

## Swap: Click on the "click me for Converter" button to swap the currencies and recalculate the conversion. This feature is useful if you want to switch between the two currencies without changing the amount.
